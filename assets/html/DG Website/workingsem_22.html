                   In this talk, we discuss generalizations of Higgs bundles on curves to higher-dimensional manifolds, consisting of pairs (E, &phi;) with E a holomorphic vector bundle on a complex manifold X and &phi; &isin; H<sup>0</sup>(X, End(E) &otimes; V), where V is a fixed holomorphic vector bundle on X. For example, when V = K<sub>X</sub>, stable pairs (E, &phi;) correspond to solutions of the Vafa-Witten equations, and when V = T<sup>*</sup><sub>X</sub> (resp. T<sub>X</sub>), such pairs are called Higgs (resp. co-Higgs) bundles. I will give an overview of some of the known results about Hitchin pairs in higher dimensions and describe some open problems.

                   Given a compact parallelizable real n-manifold M, the following theorem is known: M&cong;G/H for G a simply connected Lie group and H a discrete subgroup of G if and only if there exists n everywhere linearly independent vector fields X<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, X<sub>n</sub> and constants &alpha;<sub>ij</sub><sup>k</sup> such that for each 1 &leq; i &lt; j &leq; n, [X<sub>i</sub>, X<sub>j</sub>] = &alpha;<sub>ij</sub><sup>k</sup>X<sub>k</sub>. This is in contrast to the holomorphic case, where a compact parallelizable complex manifold is guaranteed to have such structure constants. After proving this theorem, we will look at how this result could possibly be used as a tool for an alternative proof of the Poincar&eacute; conjecture, if one were so bold.

                   In the quest to determine whether tori admit metrics of positive scalar curvature, two powerful techniques were developed: enlargeability due to Gromov and Lawson, and the stable minimal hypersurface technique due to Schoen and Yau. Having previously discussed the former, we will introduce the latter. In particular, we will show that if a closed smooth manifold admits a positive scalar curvature metric, then so does any stable minimal hypersurface.

               Given a Riemmanian manifold M endowed with calibration &alpha;, the condition that a submanifold L of M is calibrated is a first order condition. By contrast, its geometric data, given by the second fundamental form A and the induced tangent and normal connections &nabla; on TL and D on NL, respectively, is second order information. In this talk, we characterize the conditions imposed on the geometric data (A,&nabla;,D) when a submanifold L is calibrated with respect to a calibration &alpha; on M which is parallel. After that, we apply our results to some interesting calibrated geometries, such as K&auml;hler, Calabi-Yau, G<sub>2</sub> and Spin(7) manifolds.

               Conifold transitions are a general procedure for constructing new complex 3-folds from a compact K&#228;hler Calabi&#8212;Yau 3-fold by contracting disjoint (-1,-1)-curves and smoothing the resulting ODP singularities. Though we begin with a K&#228;hler manifold, the manifolds that we get may not stay K&#228;hler, which may suggest that we should seek a more "general notion of K&#228;hler". In this talk, we outline the geometry of conifold transitions and discuss results in this direction such as the balanced metrics of Fu&#8212;Li&#8212;Yau and the more recent stability results of Collins&#8212;Picard&#8212;Yau.

Any regular symplectic foliation determines a regular Poisson structure on M. However a more interesting class of Poisson structures is that of Poisson structures corresponding to irregular symplectic foliations (i.e. the dimensions of the leaves vary). In this talk, I will present some results on the  stability problem for compact leaves of Poisson manifolds. First I will review Poisson manifolds and their symplectic leaves. Then, I will explain the geometric data that encode the Poisson structure in a tubular neighborhood of a symplectic leaf S. Finally, I will explain some cohomology criterion for stability of symplectic leaves.

               In differential geometry, there is a very nice class of operators taking sections of one bundle to another known as elliptic partial differential operators. In this talk, I will prove some fundamental results about these operators, intending to give some idea for why these operators are so nice. This will come in two parts: first I will give a brief overview of the theory of (elliptic) pseudodifferential operators on ordinary multivariate functions from the perspective of Fourier analysis; then, I will show how this theory can be extended to elliptic operators between bundles. If time permits, I will show how these results can be used to prove a strong generalisation of the Hodge Decomposition Theorem.

In this talk, we construct a compact closed G<sub>2</sub> manifold with b<sub>1</sub>=0 using orbifold resolution techniques. Later, we compare it with the already-known manifolds with holonomy G<sub>2</sub>.

             Climbing a mountain is strenuous and hazardous, but the view from the top can be spectacular and makes it all worth while. There is a clear analogy with mathematics. In both cases one has to train properly, collect the right tools and gear, practice on the lower slopes, examine maps and do some background reading. After that it is a matter of hard work, patience and skill. I will look back on my 60 years of mathematics, describing what views I have seen from the heights and what challenges lie ahead for the next generation. There are many more mountain ranges to explore.

             A result of Donaldson says: with the set-up motivated by Hitchin’s variational point of view, the G<sub>2</sub> holonomy equation with boundary is elliptic mod related diffeomorphisms. Applications include the existence of a G<sub>2</sub>-cobordism between small deformations of Calabi-Yau threefolds. Similar discussions regarding boundary value problems can be also done for complex Calabi-Yau threefolds. However, it is not elliptic. Donaldson and Lehmann considered a variant of this problem called the mapping problem which asks: when could a three-form on a 5-d manifold be the pull-back of the real part of the holomorphic 3-form on a Calabi-Yau threefold under some embedding? For this, they define a class of closed strongly pseudo-convex 3-form corresponding to the CR geometry and prove that the perturbative version of this problem can be solved if a finite dimensional obstruction vector space vanishes. We will give an introduction to these results.

               I will discuss the interplay between analytic and algebraic data in the case of Riemann Surfaces. That is, to each Riemann Surface we can associate an algebraic object (function field) that completely encodes its analytic structure and given a function field we can associate a unique Riemann Surface (up to isomorphism) that completely encodes its algebraic structure. Throughout this construction I will also be proving some well-known facts about Riemann surfaces, such as the fact every compact connected Riemann Surface is an algebraic curve.

             Closed surfaces of genus at least two admit a hyperbolic metric and a compatible complex structure. Following a paper of Gauduchon, we will see this is never the case in higher dimensions: a closed hyperbolic manifold of dimension 2m > 2 does not admit a compatible complex structure. The proof uses a quantity involving scalar curvature and Weyl curvature which is similar to the Yamabe constant of a conformal class.

             We use the Weitzenb&ouml;ck formulas to get information about the Betti numbers of nearly G<sub>2</sub> and nearly K&auml;hler manifolds. First, we establish estimates on two curvature-type self adjoint operators on particular spaces assuming bounds on the sectional curvature. Then using the Weitzenb&ouml;ck formulas on harmonic forms, we get results of the form: if certain lower bounds hold for these curvature operators then certain Betti numbers are zero. Finally, we combine both steps above to get sufficient conditions of vanishing of certain Betti numbers based on the bounds on the sectional curvature.

There is a symmetric bilinear form Q on the 6-dimensional vector space W = &Lambda;<sup>2</sup> V<sup>*</sup>, which is well-defined up to scale. This bilinear form has signature (3,3). We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between conformal classes of metrics on V (that is, inner products up to positive scale) and maximal spacelike (positive-definite) subspaces of W. If time permits, we relate these ideas to the hypersymplectic structures that Amanda talked about last week.

             Every two-dimensional manifold admits a metric of constant curvature by the Uniformisation theorem. In higher dimensions, one could try to generalise this fact by asking for the existence of a metric of constant scalar curvature, constant Ricci curvature, or constant sectional curvature (these all coincide in dimension two). Each condition is more restrictive than the last. There is a plethora of constant scalar curvature metrics on every manifold, while constant sectional curvature metrics rarely exist, so focus often turns to metrics of constant Ricci curvature, also known as Einstein metrics. In dimensions five and above, there are no known examples of manifolds which fail to admit such a metric. This is in stark contrast to dimension four where the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality provides a topological obstruction. We will give the proof of this inequality, following Hitchin's original paper "Compact four-dimensional Einstein manifolds".

             I will spend the first part of the talk giving a gentle introduction to G<sub>2</sub> manifolds, with a special emphasis on their similarities and differences with Kahler manifolds. In the second part, I will focus on some recent work with Daren Cheng (Miami) and Jesse Madnick (Oregon) on the analytic properties of a special class of maps into G<sub>2</sub> manifolds, which are analogues of J-holomorphic maps in Kahler geometry. The talk should be accessible to a general mathematical audience.

             On a Riemannian manifold, Weizenbock formulas relate the usual Laplacian and the rough Laplacian along with Riemannian curvature. We consider 6-dimensional nearly Kahler manifolds and look at how the Weizenbock formula for 3-forms simplifies. We will see that a new curvature-type operator shows up which acts on symmetric 2-tensors. Assuming compactness, it will be possible to conclude the vanishing of the 3rd Betti number from a specific bound on this new operator.

             Which manifolds admit a complex structure? This is a very difficult problem with no concrete answer in general. To make some progress, it is useful to consider an intermediate structure known as an almost complex structure, whose existence is much easier to detect. Every complex manifold has an almost complex structure, so one is naturally led to consider the converse: does a manifold which admits an almost complex structure also admit a complex structure? This question has a positive answer in dimension two, a negative answer in dimension four, and is completely open in higher dimensions. We will discuss the results related to these conclusions and focus on why four dimensions is special.

             On a Riemannian manifold there is a Weitzenb&ouml;ck identity which is a relationship between the Laplacian, the Bochner Laplacian and the curvature. We will consider this formula in the nearly G<sub>2</sub> setting and see how bounds on the Weyl Tensor or Sectional Curvature can give us certain information about the Betti numbers.

             We examine hyperbolic monopoles with continuous symmetries and develop a structure theorem which generates spherically symmetric hyperbolic monopoles. To do this, we modify the steps laid out in a collaborative paper of mine wherein we proved a similar structure theorem for Euclidean monopoles. We discuss how these steps may be applied to other gauge theoretic objects.

             We define three cohomologies on an almost complex manifold (M, J), defined using the Nijenhuis-Lie derivations induced from the almost complex structure J and its Nijenhuis tensor N, regarded as vector valued forms on M. One of these can be applied to distinguish non-isomorphic non-integrable almost complex structures on M. Another one, the J-cohomology, is familiar in the integrable case but we extend its definition and applicability to the case of non-integrable almost complex structures. The J-cohomology encodes whether a complex manifold satisfies the “del-delbar-lemma”, and more generally in the non-integrable case the J-cohomology encodes whether (M, J) satisfies a generalization of this lemma. We also mention some other potential cohomologies on almost complex manifolds, related to an interesting question involving the Nijenhuis tensor. This is joint work with Ki Fung Chan and Chi Cheuk Tsang.

             A G<sub>2</sub> structure on a 7-dimensional Riemannian manifold (M,g) is determined by a stable of 3-form &#632;. It is said to be closed if d&#632;=0 and torsion-free if &#632; is parallel. The purpose of the talk is understanding certain topological properties of compact manifolds with a closed G<sub>2</sub> structure that cannot be endowed with any torsion-free G<sub>2</sub> structure.  Namely, we outline the construction of such a manifold that is non-formal and has first Betti number b<sub>1</sub>=1.

             We will start by using Dominic Joyce's book on Calibrated Geometry 'Riemannian holonomy groups and calibrated geometry' to give a nice introduction to calibration forms and calibrated submanifolds. We will then go through some sections of the paper by Harvey and Lawson titled "Calibrated geometries" to tie calibrated geometry into different areas of geometry. Ideally, we would get to talking about (special) Lagrangian submanifolds if we have the time.

             Given a slope semi-stable bundle over a projective manifold, a classical theorem by Mehta and Ramanathan states that its restriction to a generic high degree hyper-surface is still slope semi-stable. This plays a key role in Donaldson’s proof for the existence of Hermitian-Einstein metrics for stable vector bundles over projective manifolds. We will discuss Flenner’s proof of the restriction theorem, which could give an effective estimate about how large the degree is needed.

             In this talk we will look at infinite flag manifolds as classifying spaces of vector bundle filtrations, which generalizes the classifying property of infinite Grassmannians for vector bundles. The main tool for this study is the fact that real and complex flag manifolds are in general iterated fiber bundles with Grassmannian components. As such, this allows one to efficiently write down the homotopy groups and cohomology rings of flag manifolds in terms of those of the Grassmannians. Bundle extension problems and obstruction theoretic results will be looked at if time allows.
