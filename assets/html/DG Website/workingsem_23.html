           Generalised geometry is a field in differential and complex geometry in which one views the direct sum \(TM \oplus T^*M\) instead of \(TM\) as <b>the</b> bundle associated
           to a manifold \(M\). Generalised geometry has seen great success in acting as a unifying framework in which structures defined on \(TM\) and \(T^*M\) can be viewed as 
           specific instances of structures defined on \(TM \oplus T^*M\). For example, almost complex structures and pre-symplectic structures can both be viewed as generalised 
           almost complex structures, a certain kind of automorphism of  \(TM \oplus T^*M\).
           </p>  
           <p>
           In this talk, I will give an introduction to generalised geometry. I will show \(TM \oplus T^*M\) comes with an intrinsic non-degenerate bilinear form. I will introduce 
           the Dorfman bracket on \(\Gamma(TM \oplus T^*M)\), an analogue of the Lie bracket, which together with the aforementioned bilinear form gives \(TM \oplus T^*M\) the structure of a Courant algebroid. 
           I will define generalised almost complex structures in this setting, and show how almost complex structures and pre-symplectic structures can be viewed as 
           generalised almost complex structures. I will introduce generalised metrics and generalised connections, and if time permits, I will discuss integrability 
           of generalised almost complex structures in terms of generalised connections, and/or discuss the analogue of the Levi-Civita connection and what complications it comes with.

          A Nahm transform recognizes the moduli space of instantons in some setting as an isometric 'dual space'. In this sense the Nahm transform is a 'nonlinear Fourier transform'. In this talk, I will give an introduction to Nahm transforms, sketching from two different points of view the classical Nahm transform of hermitian bundles over 4-tori. Along the way, we will develop a zoo of instanton examples in all ranks using constructions from differential and complex geometry.

          Given a Riemannian manifold M with special holonomy, one obtains a distinguished parallel differential form on it, called a strongly nondegenerate form. In this talk, we show how such a form gives rise to an almost Kaehler structure on the space of higher-dimensional knots in M, and how its (infinite-dimensional) symplectic geometry corresponds to the calibrated geometry of M. We will then discuss the special case when M is Calabi-Yau, in which we obtain additional holomorphic analogues of these results.

          The McKay correspondence is a bijection between the finite subgroups of \(SL(2,C) \) and the Dynkin diagrams of the type  \( A_r, D_r, E_6, E_7, E_8.\) One bijection takes a subgroup \(G\), constructs the orbit space \( C^2/G \), resolves the singularities by inserting Riemann spheres multiple times, sees how the spheres intersect, and then constructs a graph to represent this information. Another bijection constructs irreducible representations of \( G\). We will see how these bijections are related.

These are holomorphic vector bundles on \(P^2\) along with a section \( \Phi\in H^0(End(E)\otimes\mathcal{O}(d)) \) called a Higgs field. We consider  pairs \((E,\Phi)\) that are stable for a suitable stability condition. With this we consider special rank two holomorphic bundles called “Schwarzenberger bundles” and compute how many stable pairs exist. Using deformation theory, we show that this is the dimension of the tangent space at a point \((E,\Phi) \) in the moduli space of stable Wild Vafa-Witten bundles on \( P^2 \).

          The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is amazingly cool - in one dimension it says that we can compute integrals with antiderivatives, and better yet: any continuous function always has an antiderivative! Unfortunately, that second part isn't true in higher dimensions - and it's not the fault of our functions, but rather the fault of the geometry of our spaces. This leads to an amazing idea: if we can quantify "how much" the FTC fails, we can use this to study the geometry of higher dimensions!

We then show how this beautiful function reveals connections between the symmetries of the icosahedron and the E8 lattice  - the lattice that gives the most efficient packing of spheres in 8 dimensions!

This talk gives a high-level overview of a recent graduate course which explored the relationship between Statistics and Geometry.  It looks at what the disciplines have in common but also where there are points of substantive difference.  The talk will review the long history of geometric tools finding a place in statistical practice and will highlight modern developments using ideas from convex, differential and algebraic geometry and showing applications in Neuroscience.

These obstructions involve the integral Stiefel-Whitney classes – which detect the existence of integral lifts of the mod 2 Stiefel-Whitney classes, namely putative Chern classes – and relations between the Pontryagin and Chern classes. A somewhat surprising aspect of these obstructions is that they are in fact generally proper fractional parts of what one might at first expect. For example, the obstruction in degree eleven is 1/24 of the eleventh integral Stiefel-Whitney class.

           For an oriented Riemannian manifold \((M^n, g)\), and Lie subgroup \(H \subset SO(n)\), a compatible \(H\)-structure on \((M^n,g)\) is a principal $H$-subbundle of the principal $SO(n)$-bundle of oriented orthonormal coframes.

			Multiplicative Higgs bundles are a natural analogue of Higgs bundles on Riemann surfaces, where the Higgs field now takes values on the adjoint group bundle, instead of the adjoint Lie algebra bundle. In the work of Charbonneau and Hurtubise, they have been related to singular monopoles over the product of a circle with the Riemann surface.
 
In this talk we study the natural action of an involution of the group on the moduli space of multiplicative Higgs bundles, also from the point of view of monopoles. This provides a "multiplicative analogue" of the theory of Higgs bundles for real groups.

Such metrics arise frequently in the study of special holonomy, By carefully thinking before diving in, one can extract many useful formulas for such metrics without needing to explicitly compute all of the Christoffel symbols and the curvature. For example, these include the rough Laplacian of a function or of a vector field which are invariant under the symmetry group.

			A G2-structure is a special type of 3-form on an oriented 7-manifold, which determines a Riemannian metric in a nonlinear way. The best class of such 3-forms are those which are parallel with respect to their induced Levi-Civita connections, which is a fully non-linear PDE. More generally, the torsion of a G2-structure is a 2-tensor which quantifies the failure of a G2-structure to be parallel. It is natural to consider geometric flows of G2-structures as a means of starting with a G2-structure with torsion and (hopefully) improving it in some way along the flow. I will begin with an introduction to all of these ideas, and  try to survey some of the results in the field. Then I will talk about recent joint work with Dwivedi and Gianniotis to study a large class of flows of G2-structures. In particular, we explicitly describe all possible second order differential invariants of a G2-structure which can be used to construct a quasi-linear second order flow. Then we find conditions on a subclass of these general flows which are amenable to the deTurck trick for establishing short-time existence and uniqueness.

			Given a compact hypersymplectic manifold X<sup>4</sup>, Donaldson conjectured that the hypersymplectic structure can be deformed through cohomologous hypersymplectic structures to a hyperk&auml;hler structure. Fine and Yao consider a manifold with closed G<sub>2</sub>-structure that is set up as &Topf;<sup>3</sup> &times; X<sup>4</sup>. They examine the G<sub>2</sub>-Laplacian flow under in this setting and give a flow of hypersymplectic structures which evolve according to the equation &part;<sub>t</sub> <u>&omega;</u> = d(Q d<sup>*</sup>(Q<sup>-1</sup> <u>&omega;</u>), where <u>&omega;</u> is the triple that gives the hypersymplectic structure and Q is a 3 &times; 3 symmetric matrix that relates the symplectic forms &omega;<sub>i</sub> to one another. Lotay&#8212;Wei have established long time existence of the G<sub>2</sub>-Laplacian flow provided the velocity of the flow remains bounded. Fine&#8212;Yao use this extension theorem in their setup and manage to improve it by proving long time existence of the hypersymplectic flow provided the torsion tensor T remains bounded. Furthermore, one can relate the scalar curvature and torsion tensor of manifold with closed G<sub>2</sub>-structure and thus they conclude long time existence for the hypersymplectic flow provided the scalar curvature remains bounded. In this talk we will go over some details from this paper by Fine&#8212;Yao.

              Compact K&auml;hler manifolds possess a number of remarkable properties, such as the K&auml;hler identities, the &part;<span style="text-decoration: overline;">&part;</span>-lemma, and the relation between Betti numbers and Hodge numbers. I will discuss an attempt in progress to generalize some of these ideas to more general compact U(m)-manifolds, where we do not assume integrability of the almost complex structure nor closedness of the associated real (1,1)-form. I will present a system of second order nonlinear PDEs for such a structure, of which the K&auml;hler structures form a trivial class of solutions. Any compact non-K&auml;hler solutions to this second order system would have properties that are formally similar to the above-mentioned properties of compact K&auml;hler manifolds, including relations between cohomological (albeit non-topological) data. This is work in progress with Xenia de la Ossa (Oxford) and Eirik Eik Svanes (Stavanger).

              The notion of a K&auml;hler-Ricci soliton arises from the study of the K&auml;hler-Ricci flow. They can only exist on certain manifolds, namely Fano manifolds. In this restricted case, there is an equivalent formulation which is no longer equivalent in the non-Fano case - these are called Generalised K&auml;hler-Ricci solitons. I intend to discuss both K&auml;hler-Ricci solitons and Generalised K&auml;hler-Ricci solitons, as well as some differences between them.

             Say we have a conformally horizontal submersion between two Riemannian manifolds of dimensions n and k respectively. If the domain admits a closed (n-k)-calibration form, then we can define a special type of maps which we call conformally calibrated (or Smith) maps. We will show that these maps are k-harmonic and we will see a couple of examples.

             Given a compact hypersymplectic manifold X<sup>4</sup>, Donaldson conjectured that the hypersymplectic structure can be deformed through cohomologous hypersymplectic structures to a hyperk&auml;hler structure. Fine and Yao consider a manifold with closed G<sub>2</sub>-structure that is set up as &Topf; &times; X<sup>4</sup>. They examine the G<sub>2</sub>-Laplacian flow under in this setting and give a flow of hypersymplectic structures which evolve according to the equation &part;<sub>t</sub> <u>&omega;</u> = d(Q d<sup>*</sup>(Q<sup>-1</sup> <u>&omega;</u>), where <u>&omega;</u> is the triple that the hypersymplectic structure and Q is a 3 &times; 3 symmetric matrix that relates the symplectic forms &omega;<sub>i</sub> to one another. Lotay—Wei have established long time existence of the G<sub>2</sub>-Laplacian flow provided the velocity of the flow remains bounded. Fine—Yao use this extension theorem in their setup and manage to improve it by proving long time existence of the hypersymplectic flow provided the torsion tensor T remains bounded. Furthermore, one can relate the scalar curvature and torsion tensor of manifold with closed G<sub>2</sub>-structure and thus they conclude long time existence for the hypersymplectic flow provided the scalar curvature remains bounded. In this talk we will go over some details from this paper by Fine—Yao.
