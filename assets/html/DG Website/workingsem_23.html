           I will report on work in progress with Michael Albanese, in which we prove statements claimed by Massey in 1961 concerning the obstructions to finding an almost complex structure on an orientable manifold (or more generally, reducing the structure group of a real vector bundle over a CW complex to the unitary group). These obstructions involve the integral Stiefel-Whitney classes – which detect the existence of integral lifts of the mod 2 Stiefel-Whitney classes, namely putative Chern classes – and relations between the Pontryagin and Chern classes. A somewhat surprising aspect of these obstructions is that they are in fact generally proper fractional parts of what one might at first expect. For example, the obstruction in degree eleven is 1/24 of the eleventh integral Stiefel-Whitney class.

			Verbitsky proved that Nearly Kähler 6-dimensional manifolds satisfy Kähler-type identities. These lead to a Hodge decomposition in the compact case, and restrictions on their Hodge numbers. In this talk, we discuss a new proof for most of these results that is independent of the dimension. This is work in progress with Spiro Karigiannis, Michael Albanese and Aleks Milivojevic.

           For an oriented Riemannian manifold \((M^n, g)\), and Lie subgroup \(H \subset SO(n)\), a compatible \(H\)-structure on \((M^n,g)\) is a principal $H$-subbundle of the principal $SO(n)$-bundle of oriented orthonormal coframes.  They can be described in terms of the sections of the homogeneous fibre bundle obtained by \(H\)-reduction of the oriented frame bundle. Examples of these structures include \(U(m)\)-structures, \(G_2\)-structures and \(\text{Spin(7)}\)-structures. In this talk, we will study a general theory for \(H\)-structures described in a paper of Daniel Fadel, Eric Loubeau, Andrés J. Moreno and Henrique N. Sá Earp titled "Flows of geometric structures" <a href = https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05197>(https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05197) </a>.

Finally, if time permits, we will discuss the Lagrangian Mean Curvature Flow and demonstrate that a mean curvature flow starting from a Lagrangian remains Lagrangian.

We show that the 6-manifold Z admits an almost complex structure J which respects the splitting \( TZ = VZ \oplus HZ\) given by the connection. In the horizontal directions, this complex structure J is defined in terms of the canonical 2-form on \(\Lambda^2 (T^* M)\), and in the vertical directions it is the standard complex structure on \(S^2\). We compute the Nijenhuis tensor of J evaluated on one horizontal and one vertical vector field.

			Multiplicative Higgs bundles are a natural analogue of Higgs bundles on Riemann surfaces, where the Higgs field now takes values on the adjoint group bundle, instead of the adjoint Lie algebra bundle. In the work of Charbonneau and Hurtubise, they have been related to singular monopoles over the product of a circle with the Riemann surface.
 
In this talk we study the natural action of an involution of the group on the moduli space of multiplicative Higgs bundles, also from the point of view of monopoles. This provides a "multiplicative analogue" of the theory of Higgs bundles for real groups.

			I will describe a particular class of Riemannian metrics on the total space of a vector bundle, depending only on one natural coordinate $r$, and which are thus of cohomogeneity one. Such metrics arise frequently in the study of special holonomy, By carefully thinking before diving in, one can extract many useful formulas for such metrics without needing to explicitly compute all of the Christoffel symbols and the curvature. For example, these include the rough Laplacian of a function or of a vector field which are invariant under the symmetry group. If time permits, I will explain why I care about such formulas, as they are ingredients in the study of cohomogeneity one solitons for the isometric flow of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures

			A G2-structure is a special type of 3-form on an oriented 7-manifold, which determines a Riemannian metric in a nonlinear way. The best class of such 3-forms are those which are parallel with respect to their induced Levi-Civita connections, which is a fully non-linear PDE. More generally, the torsion of a G2-structure is a 2-tensor which quantifies the failure of a G2-structure to be parallel. It is natural to consider geometric flows of G2-structures as a means of starting with a G2-structure with torsion and (hopefully) improving it in some way along the flow. I will begin with an introduction to all of these ideas, and  try to survey some of the results in the field. Then I will talk about recent joint work with Dwivedi and Gianniotis to study a large class of flows of G2-structures. In particular, we explicitly describe all possible second order differential invariants of a G2-structure which can be used to construct a quasi-linear second order flow. Then we find conditions on a subclass of these general flows which are amenable to the deTurck trick for establishing short-time existence and uniqueness.

			Given a compact hypersymplectic manifold X<sup>4</sup>, Donaldson conjectured that the hypersymplectic structure can be deformed through cohomologous hypersymplectic structures to a hyperk&auml;hler structure. Fine and Yao consider a manifold with closed G<sub>2</sub>-structure that is set up as &Topf;<sup>3</sup> &times; X<sup>4</sup>. They examine the G<sub>2</sub>-Laplacian flow under in this setting and give a flow of hypersymplectic structures which evolve according to the equation &part;<sub>t</sub> <u>&omega;</u> = d(Q d<sup>*</sup>(Q<sup>-1</sup> <u>&omega;</u>), where <u>&omega;</u> is the triple that gives the hypersymplectic structure and Q is a 3 &times; 3 symmetric matrix that relates the symplectic forms &omega;<sub>i</sub> to one another. Lotay&#8212;Wei have established long time existence of the G<sub>2</sub>-Laplacian flow provided the velocity of the flow remains bounded. Fine&#8212;Yao use this extension theorem in their setup and manage to improve it by proving long time existence of the hypersymplectic flow provided the torsion tensor T remains bounded. Furthermore, one can relate the scalar curvature and torsion tensor of manifold with closed G<sub>2</sub>-structure and thus they conclude long time existence for the hypersymplectic flow provided the scalar curvature remains bounded. In this talk we will go over some details from this paper by Fine&#8212;Yao.

Namely, if the domain of a non-zero degree map is formal, then so is the target. Some geometric applications are the formality of closed orientable manifolds with large first Betti number admitting a metric with non-negative Ricci curvature, and alternative proofs of the formality of positive quaternion-Kähler manifolds, and of singular complex varieties satisfying rational Poincaré duality.

I will discuss an attempt in progress to generalize some of these ideas to more general compact U(m)-manifolds, where we do not assume integrability of the almost complex structure nor closedness of the associated real (1,1)-form. I will present a system of second order nonlinear PDEs for such a structure, of which the K&auml;hler structures form a trivial class of solutions. Any compact non-K&auml;hler solutions to this second order system would have properties that are formally similar to the above-mentioned properties of compact K&auml;hler manifolds, including relations between cohomological (albeit non-topological) data.

Fine and Yao consider a manifold with closed G<sub>2</sub>-structure that is set up as &Topf; &times; X<sup>4</sup>. They examine the G<sub>2</sub>-Laplacian flow under in this setting and give a flow of hypersymplectic structures which evolve according to the equation &part;<sub>t</sub> <u>&omega;</u> = d(Q d<sup>*</sup>(Q<sup>-1</sup> <u>&omega;</u>), where <u>&omega;</u> is the triple that the hypersymplectic structure and Q is a 3 &times; 3 symmetric matrix that relates the symplectic forms &omega;<sub>i</sub> to one another. Lotay—Wei have established long time existence of the G<sub>2</sub>-Laplacian flow provided the velocity of the flow remains bounded. Fine—Yao use this extension theorem in their setup and manage to improve it by proving long time existence of the hypersymplectic flow provided the torsion tensor T remains bounded. Furthermore, one can relate the scalar curvature and torsion tensor of manifold with closed G<sub>2</sub>-structure and thus they conclude long time existence for the hypersymplectic flow provided the scalar curvature remains bounded. In this talk we will go over some details from this paper by Fine—Yao.
