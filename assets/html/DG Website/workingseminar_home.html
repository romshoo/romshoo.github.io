           A Nahm transform recognizes the moduli space of instantons in some setting as an isometric 'dual space'. In this sense the Nahm transform is a 'nonlinear Fourier transform'. In this talk, I will give an introduction to Nahm transforms, sketching from two different points of view the classical Nahm transform of hermitian bundles over 4-tori. Along the way, we will develop a zoo of instanton examples in all ranks using constructions from differential and complex geometry.

           Given a Riemannian manifold M with special holonomy, one obtains a distinguished parallel differential form on it, called a strongly nondegenerate form. In this talk, we show how such a form gives rise to an almost Kaehler structure on the space of higher-dimensional knots in M, and how its (infinite-dimensional) symplectic geometry corresponds to the calibrated geometry of M. We will then discuss the special case when M is Calabi-Yau, in which we obtain additional holomorphic analogues of these results.

           The McKay correspondence is a bijection between the finite subgroups of \(SL(2,C) \) and the Dynkin diagrams of the type  \( A_r, D_r, E_6, E_7, E_8.\) One bijection takes a subgroup \(G\), constructs the orbit space \( C^2/G \), resolves the singularities by inserting Riemann spheres multiple times, sees how the spheres intersect, and then constructs a graph to represent this information. Another bijection constructs irreducible representations of \( G\). We will see how these bijections are related.

These are holomorphic vector bundles on \(P^2\) along with a section \( \Phi\in H^0(End(E)\otimes\mathcal{O}(d)) \) called a Higgs field. We consider  pairs \((E,\Phi)\) that are stable for a suitable stability condition. With this we consider special rank two holomorphic bundles called “Schwarzenberger bundles” and compute how many stable pairs exist. Using deformation theory, we show that this is the dimension of the tangent space at a point \((E,\Phi) \) in the moduli space of stable Wild Vafa-Witten bundles on \( P^2 \).

           The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is amazingly cool - in one dimension it says that we can compute integrals with antiderivatives, and better yet: any continuous function always has an antiderivative! Unfortunately, that second part isn't true in higher dimensions - and it's not the fault of our functions, but rather the fault of the geometry of our spaces. This leads to an amazing idea: if we can quantify "how much" the FTC fails, we can use this to study the geometry of higher dimensions!

               A Riemannian manifold is locally conformally flat if each point admits a neighborhood in which the metric is conformal to a flat metric. In dimension at least 4, a Riemannian manifold is locally conformally flat if and only if it has vanishing Weyl curvature. We will give the proof of this theorem and explain what changes in lower dimensions.

           We present an overview of the classical theory of moment maps from symplectic geometry and their use within the Marsden-Weinstein-Mayer theory of symplectic reduction, with an emphasis on the Lie theoretic considerations that arise. If time permits, we will then discuss some attempts to generalize moment maps to the setting of G2 manifolds.

               George Bernard Shaw once said Britain and America are two counties separated by a common language. Perhaps the same can be said for Statistics and Geometry. This talk gives a high-level overview of a recent graduate course which explored the relationship between Statistics and Geometry.  It looks at what the disciplines have in common but also where there are points of substantive difference.  The talk will review the long history of geometric tools finding a place in statistical practice and will highlight modern developments using ideas from convex, differential and algebraic geometry and showing applications in Neuroscience.

           In this talk we study the geometry of the fiber bundle \(G(2,M)\) of oriented 2-planes on a Riemannian manifold \( (M,g)\) with a Spin(7) structure. More precisely, we construct an almost complex structure and we discuss how to compute its torsion when the holonomy of g is contained in Spin(7).

               We motivate and construct the bubble tree for solutions to conformally invariant equations. Next, in the context of harmonic maps we prove the No Neck Energy lemma which gives us Stability and the Bubble Tree Convergence Theorem. Finally, we mention an application which is Gromov-Witten Invariants.

               If one wants to understand representation theory of the rotation group of the icosahedron, or of its lift to Sp(1), it is extremely useful to be able to compute things intelligently. It turns out that instead of using matrices, it is much better to play with Clifford Algebras. I’ll explain those concepts and illustrate them.
