             For a given Riemannian manifold (M,g), a vector bundle E over M, we can define the vertical space VE which is a submanifold of TE. Given a connection on E we can then define the horizontal space HE which is a submanifold of TE. These spaces give us a fibre metric on TE and then we can look at the Levi-Civita connection in terms of these vertical and horizontal spaces.

We will see how bounds on the sectional curvature of R give us bounds on eigenvalues of both of those operators.

             On a two-dimensional sphere there are exactly 17746 topologically different Morse functions with 4 saddles. This result, based on combinatorics of random graphs, was obtained only a couple of years ago (during the research of Hilbert's 16th problem in real algebraic geometry on topological classification of polynomials).

[In 2007], the American mathematician L. Nikolaescu proved the Arnold conjecture that the number of such functions with T saddles on a two-dimensional sphere grows T to degree 2T (using methods going back to quantum field theory and to the mirror symmetry theory of physics).

The paper describes these studies and their counterparts for the theory of smooth functions on other manifolds, e.g. for functions on a torus and for trigonometric polynomials with a fixed Newton diagram of a given Coxter affine group.

             This was the title of the lecture Sir Michael gave in September 2013 at IHES on the occasion of the farewell conference for my retirement as Director. This was most appropriate as I learned a lot from him about this subject. It is true that mathematicians struggled for a long time to get acquainted with spinors. It is in sharp contrast with the fact that physicists adopted them without hesitation as soon as Paul-Adrien Maurice Dirac showed they were essential to formulate a quantum equation invariant under the Poincaré group. Indeed spinors have a number of features that make them both subtle and powerful to deal with mathematical problems. Of great importance are of course the natural differential operators universally defined on spinor fields, namely the Dirac and the Penrose operators. The purpose of the lecture is to revisit historical steps taken to master these objects, explore their remarkable geometric content and present some mathematical problems on which they shed light.

             Note: This is a *pre-recorded lecture* which was given as part of the Maxwell Institute's "Atiyah Lecture Series" in Edinburgh on January 11, 2021. We watched the first half of the lecture two weeks ago, and we will watch the rest of it this time. As we did last time, we will pause the video at any moment to ask each other questions and hopefully get meaningful answers from each other. We watched the first half in Fall 2021, but never finished it, and there's been a lot of turnover in our audience, so we'll just watch the whole talk from the beginning.

             Last time we discussed calibrations satisfying a Harvey-Lawson identity, and focused on the associative and coassociative cases. We also derived the general formula for determining the infinitesimal deformations of calibrated submanifolds, and worked out the coassociative case. This time we'll work out the associative case, including understanding how the normal bundle is a Clifford bundle with an associated Dirac operator. Then we'll give the Van Le - Vanzura proof of McLean's second variation formula in general.

             Consider the standard 2-sphere. Rotations around the z-axis generate a family of orbits, containing a unique maximal orbit: the equator (a geodesic). The 2-sphere is K&#228;hler, and rotations are isometries. It turns out that the above picture generalizes to this broad context (which includes for example toric manifolds), leading to an interesting interplay between (i) curvature and volume, (ii) potential theory and Riemannian submersions, (iii) Riemannian, complex and symplectic geometry. We will also discuss extensions to the recent potential theory on calibrated manifolds due to Harvey-Lawson.

I will begin by describing the questions they want to address in the paper. Then, I will focus on the first of their two main theorems, which states that in an arbitrary Riemannian manifold, every strongly stable, closed minimal submanifold has a tubular neighborhood which contains no other closed minimal submanifolds of at least the same dimension. The proof boils down to showing that the squared distance to the given submanifold has a certain convexity property.

In this talk, we take the basic (or BPST) instanton on &#8477;<sup>4</sup> with its flat hyperkähler structure and show that it has natural generalisations to &#8477;<sup>7</sup> and &#8477;<sup>8</sup> viewed as flat G<sub>2</sub>- and Spin(7)-manifolds, respectively.

             One can view &#8477;<sup>7</sup> as the total space of the bundle E = &Lambda;<sup>2</sup>-(&#8477;<sup>4</sup>) of anti-self-dual 2-forms on &#8477;<sup>4</sup>. In this way we can describe the standard flat G<sub>2</sub>-structure in terms of 4-dimensional geometry. Given an oriented surface M<sup>2</sup> in &#8477;<sup>4</sup>, the restriction of E to M decomposes as a direct sum of a line bundle and a rank 2 bundle. We determine conditions on the immersion of M<sup>2</sup> in &#8477;<sup>4</sup> that are equivalent to the total spaces of the subbundles being (respectively) associative and coassociative submanifolds. This is (very old) work of myself, Ionel, and Min-Oo from 2005. I will also discuss several ways in which it has already been generalized and ways in which it can potentially still be generalized further.

             Holomorphically (locally) homogeneous CR real hypersurfaces M<sup>3</sup> in C<sup>2</sup> were classified by Elie Cartan in 1932. A folklore legend tells that an unpublished manuscript of Cartan also treated the next dimension M<sup>5</sup> in C<sup>3</sup> (in conjunction with his study of bounded homogeneous domains), but no paper or electronic document currently circulates.

Starting from around the year 2000, significant progress was made on this 5-dimensional classification problem, and the classification was completed in 2020.  I will discuss the final aspects of this effort, in particular giving a survey of my joint work with Doubrov &amp; Merker in which we used a novel approach to settle the simply-transitive, Levi non-degenerate classification.

             Suppose M is a closed 3-manifold whose fundamental group contains a copy of the fundamental group of T<sup>2</sup> and fix a metric h on M. Given a metric g on T<sup>2</sup>, in the previous talk I described how Schoen and Yau (Annals, 1979) produced an energy minimizer among maps from (T<sup>2</sup>, g) into (M, h) that induce the same &#960;<sub>1</sub>-action as a given smooth map from T<sup>2</sup> to M, which we can choose to be &#960;<sub>1</sub>-injective thanks to the assumption on &#960;<sub>1</sub>(M).
In this talk I will explain the second stage of the minimization process, in which one varies the domain metric g. It is to prove convergence in this step that the &#960;<sub>1</sub>-injectivity of the maps found above is needed. The result is that (M, h) admits a branched immersed stable minimal torus. As mentioned last time, this prevents the ambient metric h from having positive scalar curvature, modulo ruling out the branch points, which we will not address in the talk. Instead, time permitting, I will elaborate on some of the regularity results used in the process for energy-minimizing maps from two-dimensional domains.

             The calculation of conservation laws for a differential equation has been a problem of interest for many researchers. The conservation laws that arise naturally from physics such as conservation of mass and momentum are but a drop in a bucket. This is why we are very interested in algorithms that could provide an infinite sequence of conservation laws for certain classes of evolution equations. This seminar will explore two classes of evolution equations for which there exist algorithms that create an infinite hierarchy of conservation laws for the equation. The first class are evolution equations that describe pseudo-spherical surfaces. The second class are evolution equations which admit a multi-Hamiltonian structure. Since these two classes of evolution equations share this property, the question of whether or not there exist evolution equations that describe pseudo-spherical surfaces and also admit a multi-Hamiltonian structure will be explored in the case of the KdV equation and another quintic evolution equation.

             A symmetric instanton is a solution to the finite-energy anti-self-dual instanton equation on R^4 in which the connection commutes with some perscribed group of symmetries. This talk introduces the symmetric ADHM equations for structure group SU(N), and how index-theoretic methods can be used to derive integrality theorems for different symmetry groups.
In the case of N=2 and a discrete subgroup of SU(2), we derive the prime charge theorem, which imposes a canonical choice of representation for the equations at prime number charges.
In the case of N=2 for direct product subgroups of Spin(4), we use the index theorem to resolve a problem of Allen and Sutcliffe, showing that the minimal charge of a non-trivial instanton with the symmetries of the 600-cell is 119.
Time permitting, we will describe the notion of "quasi-irreducibility" for these objects, and its use in a path to a complete classification of symmetric instantons.

             I will continue talking about the paper by Schoen and Yau (Annals, 1979) on the topological consequences of positive scalar curvature on 3-manifolds, focusing on the following special case of their main theorem: a closed 3-manifold admits no positive scalar curvature (PSC) metric if its fundamental group contains a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ &oplus; ℤ. I will begin with a quick review of my two previous talks, in which I explained how the PSC condition forbids the existence of immersed stable minimal tori, outlined how to use the assumption on the fundamental group to construct such a minimal torus, and described the initial steps of this latter construction. I will then attempt to explain the remainder of the construction, which involves minimizing the Dirichlet energy in two stages. Some classical regularity and compactness results for energy-minimizing harmonic maps will be taken for granted.

In Part 1 I explained how the PSC condition is incompatible with the existence of immersed stable minimal tori. In this talk, I'll explain how to produce such a minimal torus when the fundamental group of the 3-manifold contains a copy of Z \oplus Z. The idea is to first construct a \pi_1-injective map from the torus into the 3-manifold, and then find a stable minimal immersion by minimizing the Dirichlet energy first among maps inducing the same \pi_1-action, and then among conformal classes of metrics on the torus.

             This was the title of the lecture Sir Michael gave in September 2013 at IHES on the occasion of the farewell conference for my retirement as Director. This was most appropriate as I learned a lot from him about this subject. It is true that mathematicians struggled for a long time to get acquainted with spinors. It is in sharp contrast with the fact that physicists adopted them without hesitation as soon as Paul-Adrien Maurice Dirac showed they were essential to formulate a quantum equation invariant under the Poincaré group. Indeed spinors have a number of features that make them both subtle and powerful to deal with mathematical problems. Of great importance are of course the natural differential operators universally defined on spinor fields, namely the Dirac and the Penrose operators. The purpose of the lecture is to revisit historical steps taken to master these objects, explore their remarkable geometric content and present some mathematical problems on which they shed light.

             This is the second talk on Riemannian Submersions. In the first talk we considered the local viewpoint by introducing the O’Neil tensors and used them to get identities for the curvature of the total space in terms of the base and the fibers. In this talk we switch to the global theory. In particular, assuming completeness of the total space we will prove that a Riemannian submersion is a locally trivial fiber bundle. Next, we will focus on the case with totally geodesic fibers, which has a very interesting family of examples.

             I'll talk about one of the main theorems from the classical paper by Schoen and Yau (Annals, '79) where they find topological obstructions on a 3-manifold to the existence of metrics with positive scalar curvature (PSC). Specifically, the result says that if the fundamental group of M contains a finitely generated, non-cyclic abelian subgroup, then M does not carry any PSC metric. The method of proof resembles the Bochner technique, but uses minimal surfaces instead of harmonic forms. I'll start from the end of the story by explaining how the PSC condition is incompatible with the existence of immersed stable minimal tori. I'll then outline how they use harmonic maps to prove that the above condition on the fundamental group implies the existence of such a minimal torus. The remaining details of this last step will be described in another talk.
