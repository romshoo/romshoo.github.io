I am currently a PhD student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) under the supervision of [Spiro Karigiannis](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~karigian/). Before this, I got my Bachelor of Mathematics and Master of Mathematics in Pure Mathematics from the University of Waterloo in 2023 and 2024 respectively.     

My research interests lie in differential geometry and geometric analysis and I am especially interested in manifolds with special holonomy. I routinely talk in the [Differential Geometry Working Seminar](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~ampetcu/workingseminar_home.html).

My most recent CV is available [here](assets/pdf/CV_Romshoo_2Sep.pdf) (updated 2 September 2025).
